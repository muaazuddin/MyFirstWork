        <p>Last among the nations to emerge on the Indian subcontinent after a brief, brutal war in 1971 with Pakistan, of which it had been a part since 1947, Bangladesh (liter­ally Bengal country and formerly known as East Pakistan) is a small, impoverished and overcrowded nation. Before inde­pendence it was separated from Pakistan’s western region (formerly known as West Pakistan) by some 920 miles (1,554 km) of Indian Territory; its political link to West Pakistan was based largely on religious grounds.

        <h3>Bangladesh is very beautiful</h3>
        <p>Dissimilar in most other cultural traits (language, food habits, literary tradi­tions and history), the eastern wing of Pakistan had lived its 24 years of existence in relative neglect, and exploitation. With only one-sixth of the area of Pakistan (54,000 sq. miles or 148,000 sq. km) but over half of its population (now close to 127 million), the new nation faced seemingly insurmountable problems of exploding population, grinding poverty and lack of overall development. Unable to feed itself, it relied heavily on food, material, and technical aid from many countries, includ­ing India, which had helped it to win freedom from Pakistan.

        <h3>country is good</h3>
        <P>Nearly all of the land surface of Bangladesh is below 50 feet (15 meters) above sea level and consists of a flood plain of the Ganga-Brahmaputra Rivers and their tributaries. The delta is ac­tive and continually silting. The only hilly areas are bordering India where land rises to about 1,000 feet (304 meters), and in the southeastern section near Burma border where the relief is between 500 to 2,000 feet.</P>
